ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with LSTM ðŸš€
In this project, I had the exciting opportunity to dive into the world of stock market analysis and prediction using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

Technologies Used:
For this project, I primarily utilized the following tools and technologies:

1. Python for data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and model implementation.
2. Jupyter Notebook as the coding environment for interactive development.
3. The Keras library to build and train the LSTM model.
